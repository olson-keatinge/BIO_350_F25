However, since we happen to have class labels for this specific dataset, it is possible to use evaluation metrics that leverage this “supervised” ground truth information to quantify the quality of the resulting clusters. Examples of such metrics are the following:\n",

    "homogeneity, which quantifies how much clusters contain only members of a single class;\n",

    "KMeans and MiniBatchKMeans suffer from the phenomenon called the Curse of Dimensionality for high dimensional datasets such as text data. That is the reason why the overall scores improve when using LSA. Using LSA reduced data also improves the stability and requires lower clustering time, though keep in mind that the LSA step itself takes a long time, especially with hashed vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Silhouette Coefficient is defined between 0 and 1. In all cases we obtain values close to 0 (even if they improve a bit after using LSA) because its definition requires measuring distances, in contrast with other evaluation metrics such as the V-measure and the Adjusted Rand Index which are only based on cluster assignments rather than distances. Notice that strictly speaking, one should not compare the Silhouette Coefficient between spaces of different dimension, due to the different notions of distance they imply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The homogeneity, completeness and hence v-measure metrics do not yield a baseline with regards to random labeling: this means that depending on the number of samples, clusters and ground truth classes, a completely random labeling will not always yield the same values. In particular random labeling won’t yield zero scores, especially when the number of clusters is large. This problem can safely be ignored when the number of samples is more than a thousand and the number of clusters is less than 10, which is the case of the present example. For smaller sample sizes or larger number of clusters it is safer to use an adjusted index such as the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI). See the example Adjustment for chance in clustering performance evaluation for a demo on the effect of random labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the error bars show that MiniBatchKMeans is less stable than KMeans for this relatively small dataset. It is more interesting to use when the number of samples is much bigger, but it can come at the expense of a small degradation in clustering quality compared to the traditional k-means algorithm."
