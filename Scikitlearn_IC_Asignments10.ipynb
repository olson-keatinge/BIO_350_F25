However, since we happen to have class labels for this specific dataset, it is possible to use evaluation metrics that leverage this “supervised” ground truth information to quantify the quality of the resulting clusters. Examples of such metrics are the following:\n",

    "homogeneity, which quantifies how much clusters contain only members of a single class;\n",
