# BIO_350_F25

Starting our BOI350 assignments repo.

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- making a difference equation

IC Assignment 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- We practised exponential growth models 
- created an algorithm to model the growth of duckweed population in a pond over time. 
- we used command import matplotlib


IC in class example 1
- Very similar to the duckweed population growth model activity 
- Think I had issues so redid something maybe

Logistic growth - 1 
- Created a logistic growth model to analyse the plant population growth over time
- We considered the carrying capacity of the population - the plateau of the graph model 
- I copied code from the exponential graph and modified it to fit the logistic model

IC in class example 2 
- We imported panda and a csv data set
- Used matplotlib to plot the data set on a graph. It was no very aesthetically pleasing so we used copilot to make adjustments based on what we wanted eg align x and y axis point 0 and change the colour of graoh etc. 
- We added a carrying capacity line after finding the averages between days 17 and 60 where the population undulated. then labelled it
